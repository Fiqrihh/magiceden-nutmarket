## Smart Contract Overview

The smart contracts in this repository are designed to handle all aspects of NFT transactions. They include:

- **Minting**: The process of creating new NFTs.
- **Transfer**: Handling the transfer of ownership.
- **Listing**: Managing the sale and purchase of NFTs.
- **Freezing**: A feature that allows users to lock their NFTs.

### Smart Contract Architecture

The architecture of the smart contract is modular, allowing for easy updates and maintenance. Each component handles a specific aspect of the NFT lifecycle.

- **Minting Module**: Responsible for creating new NFTs.
- **Marketplace Module**: Manages listings and transactions.
- **Metadata Module**: Handles the metadata associated with each NFT.

## Key Concepts

### Freeze

The freeze functionality allows users to lock their NFTs temporarily. This is useful for security purposes, ensuring that no transactions can occur while the NFT is frozen.

### Listing

NFTs can be listed for sale on the marketplace. Users can set their prices and manage their listings through a simple interface.

### Metadata

Metadata is crucial for NFTs, as it provides information about the asset. This includes images, descriptions, and attributes.

### Marketplace

The marketplace is where all the buying and selling happens. Users can browse through available NFTs, view details, and make purchases.
